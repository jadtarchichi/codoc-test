This explains the high incidence of pleuropulmonary metastases originating from several cancers. The goal of this is to study the clinical manifestations of pleuro-pulmonary metastases originating from extra-thoracic cancers. We conducted a retrospective study of patients with pleuro-pulmonary metastasis whose data were collected in our department between January 2006 and december 2014. 76 patient medical records were studied. The average age was 50 years (aged 21-89 years) with a male predominance in 57.8% of cases. Clinical symptoms were mainly cough (32.8% of cases), dyspnea (23.7% of cases) and hemoptysis (11.2%). Primary cancers responsible for various pleuro-pulmonary metastases found in our case series were dominated by breast cancers in 27.6% of cases, gastro-intestinal cancers in 15.8% of cases, genital cancers in 9, 2% of cases, sarcomas in 7.8% of cases, renal cancers in 5.2% of cases, bladder cancers in 5.2% of cases, prostate cancers in 3.9% cases, ENT cancers in 3.9% of cases, thyroid cancers in 3.9% of cases, skin cancers in 2.6% of cases and cancers of unknown primary origin in 14.4% of cases respectively. Several radiologic features of pleuro-pulmonary metastases have been found in our case series; they can be isolated or combined. The most common radiologic aspect was multiple pulmonary nodules in 52.6% of cases, followed by pleurisies in 34.2% of cases, diffuse micronodules in 23.6% of cases and a solitary nodule in 3.94% of cases. Secondary pleuropulmonary cancers are frequent. They come in 3rd place after lymph nodes and liver metastases and are found in 30% of autopsies of patients with neoplasia.",

        "displayed_text": "Prediction of Breast and Prostate Cancer Risks in Male BRCA1 and BRCA2 Mutation Carriers Using Polygenic Risk Scores. <br><br> Purpose BRCA1/2 mutations increase the risk of breast and prostate cancer in men. Common genetic variants modify cancer risks for female carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations. We investigated-for the first time to our knowledge-associations of common genetic variants with breast and prostate cancer risks for male carriers of BRCA1/ 2 mutations and implications for cancer risk prediction. Materials and Methods We genotyped 1,802 male carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations from the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 by using the custom Illumina OncoArray. We investigated the combined effects of established breast and prostate cancer susceptibility variants on cancer risks for male carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations by constructing weighted polygenic risk scores (PRSs) using published effect estimates as weights. Results In male carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations, PRS that was based on 88 female breast cancer susceptibility variants was associated with breast cancer risk (odds ratio per standard deviation of PRS, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.56; P = 8.6 a\u2014 10(-6)). Similarly, PRS that was based on 103 prostate cancer susceptibility variants was associated with prostate cancer risk (odds ratio per SD of PRS, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.35 to 1.81; P = 3.2 a\u2014 10(-9)). Large differences in absolute cancer risks were observed at the extremes of the PRS distribution. For example, prostate cancer risk by age 80 years at the 5th and 95th percentiles of the PRS varies from 7% to 26% for carriers of BRCA1 mutations and from 19% to 61% for carriers of BRCA2 mutations, respectively. Conclusion PRSs may provide informative cancer risk stratification for male carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations that might enable these men and their physicians to make informed decisions on the type and timing of breast and prostate cancer risk management.",

In vivo, features of epithelial-mesenchymal transition have been associated with tumor budding, which correlates significantly with patient outcome. Hereby, the majority of tumor buds are not truly detached but still connected to a major tumor mass. For detailed insights into the different tumor bud types and the process of tumor budding, we quantified tumor cells according to histomorphological and immunohistological epithelial-mesenchymal transition characteristics. Three-dimensional reconstruction from adenocarcinomas (pancreatic, colorectal, lung, and ductal breast cancers) was performed as published. Tumor cell morphology and epithelial-mesenchymal transition characteristics (represented by zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 and E-Cadherin) were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively in a three-dimensional context. Tumor buds were classified into main tumor mass, connected tumor bud, and isolated tumor bud. Cell morphology and epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker expression were assessed for each tumor cell. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition characteristics between isolated tumor bud and connected tumor bud demonstrated no significant differences or trends. Tumor cell count correlated significantly with epithelial-mesenchymal transition and histomorphological characteristics. Regression curve analysis revealed initially a loss of membranous E-Cadherin, followed by expression of cytoplasmic E-Cadherin and subsequent expression of nuclear zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1. Morphologic changes followed later in this sequence. Our data demonstrate that connected and isolated tumor buds are equal concerning immunohistochemical epithelial-mesenchymal transition characteristics and histomorphology. Our data also give an insight in the process of tumor budding. While there is a notion that the epithelial-mesenchymal transition zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1-E-Cadherin cascade is initiated by zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1, our results are contrary and outline other possible pathways influencing the regulation of E-Cadherin.",

These interesting attributes coupled with its aberrant expression in cancer have rendered PDEF a focus of increasing interest by tumor biologists. This review provides a current understanding of the characteristics of PDEF expression and its role in breast cancer. The bulk of the evidence is consistent with PDEF overexpression in most breast tumors and an oncogenic role for this transcription factor in breast cancer. In addition, high PDEF expression in estrogen receptor-positive breast tumors showed significant correlation with poor overall survival in several independent cohorts of breast cancer patients. Together, these findings demonstrate PDEF to be an oncogenic driver of breast cancer and a biomarker of poor prognosis in this cancer. Based on this understanding and the limited expression of PDEF in normal human tissues, the development of PDEF-based therapeutics for prevention and treatment of breast cancer is also discussed.",

Although MAGEA1's expression levels have been evaluated as one of the cancer testis (CT) antigens for immunotherapy in melanoma and several other cancers, its functional role and signaling mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we examined the functional involvement and signaling mechanisms of MAGEA1 in breast and ovarian cancer cells. Inhibitory effects of MAGEA1 on cell proliferation and migration were observed using both gain-of- (MAGEA1 overexpression) and loss-of- (siRNA interference) function approaches in breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and ovarian (SKOV3 and SKOV3ip) cancer cell lines. We revealed a novel interaction between MAGEA1 and the intracellular segment of NOTCH1 receptor (NICD1). MAGEA1 reduced NICD1's stability by promoting the ubiquitin modification of NICD1. MAGEA1 also interacted with FBXW7, subunit of E3 ubiquitin protein ligase complex SCF, and the latter was functionally involved in NICD1 ubiquitination and degradation. In addition, siRNA interference of FBXW7 reversed the inhibitory effect of MAGEA1 on migration and proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. These newly discovered MAGEA1-NICD1 and MAGEA1-FBXW7 interactions have potential clinical implications in breast and ovarian cancer treatment.Oncogene advance online publication, 1 May 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2017.131.",

Despite improvements in managing non-small cell lung cancer, long-term survival remains very low. This study evaluated survival improvement in patients with non-small cell lung cancer in each decade between 1983 and 2012 to determine the impact of race, sex, age, and socioeconomic status on the survival rates in these patients. We extracted data on non-small cell lung cancer cases in each decade between 1983 and 2012 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries. In total, 573,987 patients with non-small cell lung cancer were identified in 18 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry regions during this period. The 12-month relative survival rates improved slightly across three decades, from 39.7% to 40.9% to 45.5%, with larger improvement in the last two decades. However, the 5-year-relative survival rates were very low, with 14.3%, 15.5%, and 18.4%, respectively, in three decades, indicating the urgency for novel comprehensive cancer care. In addition, our data demonstrated superiority in survival time among non-small cell lung cancer patients of lower socioeconomic status and White race. Although survival rates of non-small cell lung cancer patients have improved across the three decades, the 5-year-relative survival rates remain very poor. In addition, widening survival disparities among the race, the sex, and various socioeconomic status groups were confirmed. This study will help in predicting future tendencies of incidence and survival of non-small cell lung cancer, will contribute to better clinical trials by balancing survival disparities, and will eventually improve the clinical management of non-small cell lung cancer.",

Methodology This study utilized a survey of medical knowledge, attitudes and practices applied to fifth year Colombian medical students attending the Universidad de los Andes in the first semester of 2013. Results 64/76 students answered the surveys (response rate 84.2 % ): 62.5 % (40/64) and 37.5 % (24/64) response rates from students in their ninth and tenth semesters, respectively; and 64.1 % (41/64) and 35.9 % (23/64) response rates from female and male students, respectively. Knowledge: clinical breast exam (CBE), breast self-examination (BSE) and mammography were recommended by 95.3 % (61/64) of students, 96.9 % (62/64) of medical students and 90.7 % (58/64) of students, respectively. Attitude: the most effective tests to reduce mortality in women aged a\u2030\u00a5 50 years were the Papanicolaou test according to 90.6 % (58/64) of students and mammography according to 82.8 % (53/64) of students. Practice: 55.0 % (35/64) of students had received training in the guidelines and protocols for breast neoplasm and uterine cervical neoplasm screening. Discussion To promote early detection of cervical and breast cancer, knowledge, attitudes and practices must be improved to enhance clinical practices (e.g. Papanicolaou test) and medical student training guidelines or protocols for these two cancers. Overall, with induced demand and support from research communities and institutions seeking to make these improvements, we collaborate to decrease missed opportunities in medical research and Public Health.",
